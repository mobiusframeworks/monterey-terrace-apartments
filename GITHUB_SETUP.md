# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Since the GitHub CLI is not available, please follow these steps:

## Option 1: Create Repository on GitHub.com

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `monterey-terrace-apartments`
3. Description: "Monterey Terrace Apartments website - 7680 Monterey Road, Downtown Gilroy, CA"
4. Choose **Public** repository
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

7. After creating, GitHub will show you commands. Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/monterey-terrace-apartments.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username.

## Option 2: I can try to push if you provide your GitHub username

Let me know your GitHub username and I'll set up the remote for you.
