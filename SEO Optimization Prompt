Prompt for Claude (paste this in):
You are an expert local SEO strategist and real-estate copywriter.
Your task is to help me rank an apartment complex in Google for people searching for places to live in Gilroy, California.
Goal
Optimize our website + Google Business Profile so we show up when people search things like:


“apartments gilroy”


“high end apartments gilroy”


“apartments near me” (from people physically in or near Gilroy)


We do accept pets, but I do not want pets to be the main selling point. Mention “pet-friendly” briefly and positively, but keep the focus on quality, comfort, safety, location, and amenities. Emphasize that the property is clean, well-managed, and quiet, with responsible pet rules.
Property details (use these as facts; ask me if you need more):


Property name: [INSERT NAME]


Address / neighborhood: [INSERT ADDRESS / AREA IN GILROY]


Type: high-end apartments (nice finishes, safe, well-maintained)


Unit mix: [e.g., 1–2 bedroom apartments, etc.]


Key amenities: [parking, in-unit laundry, remodeled kitchens, pool, etc.]


Target renters: [young professionals, small families, commuters, etc.]


Tone & style


Professional but friendly and clear.


Focus on livability, convenience, and value.


Natural language; no obvious keyword stuffing. Use target phrases where they fit smoothly.



What I want you to produce


SEO keyword plan


A short list of primary and secondary keywords, focused on Gilroy, that I should target on the homepage and Google Business Profile.


Include exact phrases like “apartments gilroy”, “high end apartments gilroy”, and “apartments near me”, plus related long-tail phrases.




Homepage SEO copy


(a) 3 options for an H1 headline for the homepage.


(b) A 250–300 word “hero” section for the homepage that naturally uses the main keywords and mentions that we’re quietly pet-friendly without making it the focus.


(c) 3–5 short bullet points highlighting key features (parking, location, finishes, safety, etc.).




Meta tags


3 variations of meta title (max ~60 characters) optimized for “apartments gilroy” and “high end apartments gilroy”.


3 variations of meta description (max ~155 characters) encouraging clicks from people looking for apartments in Gilroy.




Google Business Profile description


A 700–750 character description written specifically for Google Business Profile, using local terms like “Gilroy apartments”, “near downtown Gilroy / near Hwy 101” (if accurate), etc.


Mention pet-friendly once, in a low-key way.




Local SEO content ideas


8–10 blog or landing page ideas that would help us rank for apartment-related searches in Gilroy (e.g., “moving to Gilroy apartment guide”, “best neighborhoods in Gilroy for commuters”, etc.).




FAQ section


6–8 FAQ questions and answers about the apartments (pricing range, lease terms, parking, safety, pet policy, nearby schools/shopping, etc.), written to capture more “people also ask” style searches.




Please structure your response with clear headings for each section, and keep everything tailored specifically to Gilroy, CA and to a high-end apartment complex. Do not invent wild amenities; stay realistic for a nice but not ultra-luxury property.

If you want, I can also help you draft the actual meta titles, homepage copy, and GBP description right here before you take it to Claude.
